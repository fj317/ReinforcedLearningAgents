# Reinforced Learning Agents
Various agents that implement reinforced learning algorithms in different environments

## Q-Learning.ipynb
The environment is based on a gridworld environment with two objects being present: a bomb - if hit by the agent, it gives a reward of -10 and terminates the episode; and a goal state - if reached a reward of 10 is given and the episode termiantes. The agent has four possible actions in each state (grid square): west, north, south, and east. The actions are unreliable. They move the agent in the intended direction with probability 0.8, and with probability 0.2, they move the agent in a random other direction. If the direction of movement is blocked, the agent remains in the same grid square. The initial state of the agent is one of the five grid squares at the top, selected randomly. A reward of -1 is given to the agent for each navigational action. The agent uses a Q-Learning algorithm that creates a table if each state-action pair and assigns a Q-value to it. Using these Q-Values the agent can find the best path to the goal from its initial starting square. A learning curve is also plotted, showing the mean total reward the agent collects over each episode. A random agent is also implemented as a comparison tool.
